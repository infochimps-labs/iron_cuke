Feature: Checking Ports
  In order to test the <%= "#{@sys}-#{@subsys}" %> component
  As a system administrator
  I want to examine the ports of node <%= @server %>
        
  Scenario: The proper ports are open
    Then these ports are open:
      | port |
   <% @ports.each do |port| %>
      | <%= port[:port] -%> |
   <% end %>
