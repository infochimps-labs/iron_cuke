Feature: Checking Ports
  In order to test the <%= "#{@sys}-#{@subsys}" %> component
  As a system administrator
  I want to examine the ports of this node

  Scenario: The proper ports are open
    Then these ports are open:
      | port | host |
   <% @ports.each do |name, port| %>
      | <%= port %> | <%= `hostname -f`.delete("\n") %> |
   <% end %>
